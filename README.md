# Library-DBMS

The aim of this database management system is to provide a user-friendly environment so that customer or library staff can easily perform the tasks/operations in an efficient manner.

The database application allows users to store the book details and the customer details. Users can interact with the database in the following ways: they can contribute
to the database (e.g. search the book/submit a new book information - this would require an appropriate ISBN, Title, Category, Author, Publisher, Status of the book) etc, they can issue the books and take the returns for the same (e.g. put in issue/return id, book name, customer id, issue/return date, & ISBN), and users can also fill in the customer information (e.g. Customer’sname and id, books issued to customer, their address and the registration date).
