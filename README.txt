# Library-DBMS-
Semester long group project with the goal of building a complete database management system.

Library is referred to as a collection or organized information and resources, made available to
customers for the purpose of borrowing or just as reference. These information and resources are
made available to the customers either in physical format (Handed over to the person in an actual
building or room) or digitally (virtually) or even both. The aim of this database management
system is to provide a user-friendly environment so that customer or library staff can easily
perform the tasks/operations in an efficient manner.

Our database application allows users to store the book details and the
customer details. Users can interact with the database in the following ways: they can contribute
to the database (e.g. search the book/submit a new book information - this would require an
appropriate ISBN, Title, Category, Author, Publisher, Status of the book) etc, they can issue the
books and take the returns for the same (e.g. put in issue/return id, book name, customer id,
issue/return date, & ISBN), and users can also fill in the customer information (e.g. Customerâ€™s
name and id, books issued to customer, their address and the registration date).
